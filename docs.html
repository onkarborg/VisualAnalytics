    Being from a programming background in CS, I am well versed with HTML,CSS,JS & Jquery. Hence, I began working directly on D3.
    D3 was a challenging language for me. It took me a week to understand it. I spent the other 2 weeks coding my design idea and finishing my project.
</p>
<p>
    Next I made some rough sketches as what I expect a basic chart would look like:
    </p>
    <image src="IMG_0162[1].JPG" height="100" width="100"></image>
    <image src="IMG_0163[1].JPG" height="100" width="100"></image>
<p>
    Design Choices:
    <ul>
    <li>I wanted to make the colors prominent hence i decided to go with a dark background.</li>
    <li>I also wanted the elements to move around or 'behave' reflecting some changes made by the user. Hence, animating the Pie chart.</li>
    <li>I used many color schemes, but ended up using my own color choices. I wanted to use complementary colors.</li>
    <li>I also wanted to make big graphs with big elements for clarity.</li>
    <li>I realised the scatter plot was not clear as most regions had very low values for datasets compared to some large countries. Using log scales or non-linear scales was out of the question.</li>
    <li>I simple removed the major regions such as "Asia" etc aside, to make the scatter plot more clear.</li>
    <li>I used a Data map from https://www.jasondavies.com/ to represent the Heat Map.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>How it helps users:</li>
    <li>This method of representing data helps the user visualize years of data together of multiple countries.</li>
    <li>It also helps the users to view regional trends using color coded scatter plots</li>
    <li>The Pie Chart helps understand the distribution of Energy data between the major regions.</li>
    <li>The Heat Map helps to visualize the energy distribution of one energy type all over the world in a most wholistic view.</li>
</ul>
