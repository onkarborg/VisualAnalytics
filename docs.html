    Your design process: I first started with studying the data format. I needed to first understand the data to visualize it better;
    Next I made some rough sketches as what I expect a basic chart would look like.

    I needed to make an interactive webpage to
    How did you go about designing the visualization? What are some of the initial designs / ideas you attempted in the beginning?
    A good way to document your design process is to scan your sketches and include them in the documentation page.
    Rationale of your design choices: This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made.
    For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?
    Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had.
    Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization (more on this).
    A 2-4 minutes YouTube video showing the use of your visualization with narration.
    This video should be embedded in your documentation page. \
    The video should be created using a screen-capture tool while interacting with the visualization.
    It should ideally be similar in style to the videos that accompany papers at the IEEE VIS or ACM CHI conferences.
    Here are a couple of good examples: UpSet, and GPLOM
