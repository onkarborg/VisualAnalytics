    Being from a programming background in CS, I am well versed with HTML,CSS,JS & Jquery. Hence, I began working directly on D3.
    D3 was a challenging language for me. It took me a week to understand it. I spent the other 2 weeks coding my design idea and finishing my project.
</p>
<p>
    Next I made some rough sketches as what I expect a basic chart would look like:
</p>
<div><image src="IMG_0162[1].JPG" height="300" width="300"></image><image src="IMG_0163[1].JPG" height="300" width="300"></image></div>
<p>
    Design Choices:
<ul>
    <li>I wanted to make the colors prominent hence i decided to go with a dark background.</li>
    <li>I also wanted the elements to move around or 'behave' reflecting some changes made by the user. Hence, animating the Pie chart.</li>
    <li>I used many color schemes, but ended up using my own color choices. I wanted to use complementary colors.</li>
    <li>I also wanted to make big graphs with big elements for clarity.</li>
    <li>I realised the scatter plot was not clear as most regions had very low values for datasets compared to some large countries. Using log scales or non-linear scales was out of the question.</li>
    <li>I simple removed the major regions such as "Asia" etc aside, to make the scatter plot more clear.</li>
    <li>I used a Data map to represent the Heat Map.</li>
    <li>I grouped all the controls together and away from the charts so that the user doesn't have to spend to much time finding controls and the charts are clear</li>
    <li>I parsed the data in many ways to enable plotting of bar chart as well as scatter plot. ie. parse data row wise as well as column wise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>How it helps users:</li>
    <li>This method of representing data helps the user visualize years of data together of multiple countries.</li>
    <li>It also helps the users to view regional trends using color coded scatter plots</li>
    <li>The Pie Chart helps understand the distribution of Energy data between the major regions.</li>
    <li>The Heat Map helps to visualize the energy distribution of one energy type all over the world in a most wholistic view.</li>
</ul>
